What component was responsible for reading files?
    Model - needs the info from the file
    Controller - deals with I/O
    Outside of MCV - relevant for MVC components
    Solution: Should be in controller because it deals with I/O
        NEED: rework model playGame and move methods to controller package somehow

What are the behaviors of your model?
    void startGame(File, File)
    void placeCard(Card, int, int)
    void startGame(Optional<Cell>[][], List<Card>, Set<PlayerColor>, boolean (shuffle))
    void swapPlayers()
    boolean isRedTurn()
    boolean isGameOver()
        Should probably change signature of playToGrid(int int int) to just take in a card index than a card

BattlePhase and PlayCard
    Should be separate to make variation easier
    Add BattlePhase to interface
    Can compromise model integrity, though
    However you can just rely on your controller
    Either way is fine though

Player should probably be stored in Card not Cell
