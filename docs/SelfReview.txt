What we wish we had done differently in our design/implementation was
to improve upon our controller. We believe it should have done less handling,
with more things being delegated to the view/model respectively such as some of
the uses of handleCellClicked, having it as a whole be replaced by different methods.
Also, a design the mistake on our end was having our Cell class keep track of the player color
while this should have been delegated to the card specifically. Additionally, we should have been
more mindful of how we used parameterization. Our provider's code helped us recognize our
mistake with the Cell class, whilst our customer's requests notified us of the limitations of our
controller specifically regarding the handleCellClicked method.

Overall, our experience with our provider was mediocre. Of the two requests we emailed them about
they were moderately fast in response time and were able to supply us with the necessary Card
interface. However, our second request to flip two lines of code in their DrawHand method was
left unfulfilled despite us emailing twice. Additionally, at the very beginning of the assignment
they provided us the code a day late sending it over on Monday rather than Sunday
after being re-notified by the professor that day.
