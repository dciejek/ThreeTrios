The interfaces we were given were very flexible, however, they implemented a lot of
base Java classes that we were not familiar with and had to look up documentation to understand, but
once we understood, it, overall, made their implementation very concise

The views are fully capable, however some quality of life changes like making borders thicker
would be nice. Also, when the game is over, the view is still updated over their hand, which does
not impact anything with the game, but it doesnt make sense for the listener on the hand panel to
still be active. Their code was very easy to use and reuse, followed a logical path and was
exceptionally documented, although it was sometimes vague because of how robust their classes were.
Very cleanly written, some tastefully used helper methods and overall good design with method names
and actions. Although some of the vocab used in documentation left something to be desired as it was
a little vague.

There were two large changes we asked of them. The first was to change their card implementation, as
the one that was given was final and proved very difficult to adapt, so they sent us an interface
with the same functionality. Then, we noticed a bug in their view regarding the DrawHand class'
renderCard method, where the east and west values were flipped when their were displayed. However,
they did not get back to us so we made the change ourself and included in the README.
