Overview:
Play a complete game of three trios with two players, and code it with room for later modification.
Playing this game should consist of a place phase, battle phase, and combo phase.
The entirety of the game should be displayed using a text based view.

Quick start:
ThreeTriosModel<PlayingCard> model = new TTModel();
model.startGame(new File("docs" + File.separator + “3x3Grid”),
        new File("docs" + File.separator + "cards1"))
model.placeCard(model.getCurrentPlayer().getHand().get(0), 1, 1)

Key Components:
Grid
- is arena where three trios is played
Players (playerOne, playerTwo)
- the players control a hand of cards
- they play these cards onto the grid
- these cards battle adjacent cards of the opposite player
- if they win the battled card now belongs to the player that won
- causing a combo effect if multiple cards lose to their adjacent competitor

Key Sub-Components:
Grid Cells (must be an odd number)
- Hole Cell is a cell that cannot contain a card
- Card Cell is a cell that can contain a card and belong to a player
- # of playable cells is the count of Card Cells in the Grid without a card
Player Cards
- Have a color associated with the given player
- Can exist on the grid or in the players hand
- # is equal to the (# Card Cells on the grid + 1) / 2 per player
