Overview:
Play a complete game of three trios with two players, and code it with room for later modification.
Playing this game should consist of a place phase, battle phase, and combo phase.
The entirety of the game should be displayed using a text based view.

Quick start:
ThreeTriosModel<PlayingCard> model = new TTModel();
model.startGame(new File("docs" + File.separator + “3x3Grid”),
        new File("docs" + File.separator + "cards1"))
model.placeCard(model.getCurrentPlayer().getHand().get(0), 1, 1)

Key Components:
Model
-Based on a text file input (which is parsed) allocate the specifications for the
grid and player (size, cards)
-Instantiates the grid and player hands
-Play cards from hand to grid to locations as specified by the input from controller
-Verify game states post move (has the game started, do any cards battle,
is the game over, who won the game)
View
-A Simple text based view that displays the grid, the players hands,
as well as what color player the card belongs to as denoted by "R" or "B"
based on the contents as given by the model (grid, hand)
Controller
-Not Yet Implemented

Key Sub-Components:
Grid
- is arena where three trios is played
Players (playerOne, playerTwo)
- the players control a hand of cards
- they play these cards onto the grid
- these cards battle adjacent cards of the opposite player
- if they win the battled card now belongs to the player that won
- causing a combo effect if multiple cards lose to their adjacent competitor
Grid Cells (must be an odd number)
- Hole Cell is a cell that cannot contain a card
- Card Cell is a cell that can contain a card and belong to a player
- # of playable cells is the count of Card Cells in the Grid without a card
Player Cards
- Have a color associated with the given player
- Can exist on the grid or in the players hand
- # is equal to the (# Card Cells on the grid + 1) / 2 per player
